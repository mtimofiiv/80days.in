Hello, dear readers. Some people say I'm a good writer, and I will do my best, but some of the things I'm going to try to express in this post just demonstrate to me how shallow the pool of language really is in describing them.

First, my apologies. We've been in Phnom Penh, Cambodia now for three months and I haven't written this sooner. But it has been three months. Three months full of highs and lows.

Phnom Penh itself is the centre of Cambodia, situated on the meeting of three rivers – the mighty Mekong flowing from Tibet via China and Lao, its tributary the Bassac, and the Tonlé Sap. Last night, the heavens opened up and the long awaited rains finally came, relieving themselves in the night sky amid bombastic displays of lightning.

To a Westerner, its chaotic pace is alien – admirable in some ways, disturbing in others. The motos buzz past in a swarm around the cars in traffic, and the river clam and cane juice vendors carve their path through it on foot pushing their carts. The tuk tuks swerve endlessly from side to side among both the elephantine cars and the hyena-like moto schools. Every once in a while, a massively over-stuffed vehicle makes its way through, piled high with disposable foam takeout containers or construction materials or sometimes livestock, alive or dead.

The reality of this city is that polar opposites can coexist next to each other. A beggar pushes himself on a tiny wooden board with wheels in front of a Bentley car dealership, the remaining parts of his missing legs jaggedly laid out in front of him. A woman sits nursing her two children, begging for money on a bridge full of tourist's children playing with fancy toys. A massive compound tailor-made for foreigners, sporting office and coworking space, a fancy cafe, trampoline and luxury apartments is one thin concrete wall from a small local market where no sign of imported espresso beans can be found, only raw fish, meat and vegetables for sale under the shade of sun umbrellas.

It's hard to imagine that this city was evacuated in 48 hours by the Khmer Rouge, its people sent to the countryside to work rice fields in a misguided attempt to create an agrarian, _autarky_ society beyond anything communism or fascism could ever have concieved. I was three years old when The Republic of Vietnam finally decided enough was enough and drove the genocidal monsters to all but a thin strip along the Thai border. The country is still picking up the pieces of its recent past.

The city is also a true melting pot of every kind. The Chinese with their new money mindset, perhaps built on a caricature of what rich Westerners do with their money. Westerners with their NGOs and a mix of idealistic naïveté and good intentions. People from all over the fractured Soviet empire, with their fatalist humour and pragmatic, philosophical way to cut to the heart of this world by reading between its lines. And people like me, born in the East and raised in the West by Eastern parents.

But then, time passes, and the excitement and wonder of the new thing wears off, and the daily routine of life sets in. Several of my friends in Netherlands and Canada that I've talked to joke about how I'm on a long vacation. I'm not – I just don't have a home. And when the sensation of feeling around for the pulse of a new place ultimately resolves to new routines, a person is left with what they started with before they left their life before – themselves.

It's a hard thing to land face-first onto a mirror, high on travel. Not because I didn't want to see myself there, but without the aquired comforts of permanently being somewhere stable and its distractions, a person has to confront certain things about themselves which require work to deal with. And the sudden onset of seeing your insecurities and flaws exposed so vividly ultimately leads to a confrontation with oneself.

And the reason is that every time I move, I have to start much of my life from scratch. New friends. New apartment. New coworking space. New things to do. New takes on what to do for fitness. New transportation. New routines. I have to be aggressive to find those things. Because if I don't, I personally lose – either with being lonely, or overpaying, or with doing twice the work for something than needed. And I made mistakes along the way, mistakes that I am not waiting till the next "cycle" to fix, mistakes that I am fixing now. I see it as practice for the next reset.

But back to Phnom Penh itself – one thing I learned is that the insulation between humans and our changing environment is a luxury Cambodia does not have. The reason is that for example, this year has been an incredibly hot one, and since the country relies on hydro for a large portion of its energy, water and power shortages are a real thing here. Private businesses use diesel generators to fill the gap as the national grid rolls blackouts even here in Phnom Penh, neighbourhood by neighbourhood. Demand is simply too high and growing.

An unusually hot year also has consequences we have not seen fully develop yet, such as the impact on agriculture. In a wildlife sanctuary we went to, water is piped from a local reservoir 20km away, and when the water level drops, many animals need alternative water supplies. In a way, the mass migration of trying to craft Cambodia into an agrarian society attempted by the Khmer Rouge all those years ago could be seeing a reverse but similar act, carried out by the environment itself – the reality that losses in agricultural profit will send rural people into cities en masse in search of subsistence is a very real possibility.

Reducing, reusing and recycling are top of mind for locals here, with a focus on sustainable reuse of materials, with production of, for example, metal straws and bags made of fabric from old fishing nets. Living here has made me see clearest of all:

_Humanity is a man sitting in a giant cauldron, outside, in the middle of winter, and he decided to start a fire under it for warmth. The fire's now out of control, and there is no escape. Cambodia is his foot, which rests on the cauldron's bottom, and feels the heat earlier and worse than the rest._
