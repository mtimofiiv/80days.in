"We call it a 'monkey wedding' in South Africa," said Dave, as all the people in our office looked out of our big window at the golden sunshine in a blue sky reflecting off the falling nails of raindrops outside. This is Amsterdam in September, where the weather dries and wets you at the same time, and makes about as much sense as monkeys getting married.

Dave, like the others sitting here at the beautiful old merchant mansion (next to the Mayor's residence) on the iconic Herengracht, is a scrappy entrepreneur tirelessly scratching out a startup from nothing. The space is called _Hackers & Founders_, which is a meetup-turned-community of tech people enjoying the current boom in innovation and accessibility created by the commercial internet. Just about anyone can build a product these days, but it doesn't mean you'll succeed. Some have – Dave's company works with retail businesses to help them solve their loyalty headaches, while another called _HackYourFuture_, a bootcamp to train refugees to code, along with many other awesome projects.

It's from here, in the Hackers & Founders garden that I typically work from. Since September last year, I've been working on building my own business as a freelance web developer. I've also spent time working on my own projects including [Pinmark.io](https://pinmark.io) and now [Parlay.work](https://parlay.work) (Parlay's going to launch next month!).

Since I moved here, I've also had a son – his name's Krim (Крым – after the [Crimean penninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea)) and he's now two. He's technically entered into what is known as the "twee is nee" age ("two is no"), but so far, being around him has been more enjoyable than before when he was more of a...how shall I put this, _blob_ that needs to be fed, changed and vomits everywhere. The little guy has personality quirks. He plays his own games and is obsessed with _deedaas_ (aka trucks with sirens), and he loves it when papa throws him in the air and catches him, or chases him through the house. And every once in a while he does something hilarious like accidentally makes _portmanteau_ of Dutch and English words, such as mixing up the English _bye_ with the Dutch _dag_ which ends up with him telling people to _die_ when they leave.

And now it's time to move on. Maybe you can say I am serially addicted to moving around, or that I'm restless and can't sit still, but I don't really care, that's what I am.
