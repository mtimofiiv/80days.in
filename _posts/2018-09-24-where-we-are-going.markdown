"We call it a 'monkey wedding' in South Africa," said Dave, as all the people in our office looked out of our big window at the golden sunshine in a blue sky reflecting off the falling nails of raindrops outside.

Dave, like the others sitting here at the beautiful old merchant mansion (next to the Mayor's residence) on the iconic Herengracht, is a scrappy entrepreneur tirelessly scratching out a startup from nothing.
