Time. I guarantee it flows differently for you, as it does for me. _A watched pot never boils_, as the saying goes – and that doesn't make my frame of time any more valid than yours, and in fact, our competing notions of how time passes by are equally wrong and right at the same time.

But what time is the correct time?

[Einstein's _Theory of Relativity_](https://www.space.com/17661-theory-general-relativity.html) means that the body of the Earth warps space and time around it. So, for example, a clock on a satellite orbiting the Earth would perceive time flowing at 45 microseconds faster than the one on the Earth's surface.

So, the perception of time on Earth and in space is different not just because of two different people having different perceptions but also due to the physical laws of the universe.

For me right now, time races by – days seem short and weeks seem to disappear behind me. It's the end of June now, and I can't believe I've been in Da Nang for almost a month!
