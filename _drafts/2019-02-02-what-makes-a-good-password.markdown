750 million email + password combinations were recently leaked by hackers in a compilation of various databases that companies did a shit job securing (security researcher Troy Hunt has this great website, [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com/), if you want to check if your passwords are in there). What Troy does is he goes to those shady places on the internet that are full of scum and villainry and downloads their "credential dumps" as they're called. He then puts them up on his website, so you only need to type in your email to see if you've been affected.

But what he also does with the data he gets is releases studies on the passwords used. And what he keeps finding is disturbing to say the least: **the most common password people use is "123456".**
